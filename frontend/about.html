    <h1>About Our Hackathon Project</h1>
    <p>
      This project demonstrates a simulation of <strong>wind speed</strong> and 
      <strong>thunderstorm prediction</strong> using machine learning models trained on 
      historical weather data.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The backend is powered by <strong>Flask</strong> and continuously streams predictions 
      from a validation dataset to mimic real-time weather forecasting.  
    </p>
    <p>
      On the frontend, we use <strong>Leaflet.js</strong> for map visualizations, where 
      wind predictions and thunderstorm probabilities are displayed dynamically.  
    </p>
    <p>
      This hackathon solution can be extended to real-world scenarios by connecting to 
      live weather APIs and integrating with alert systems.  
    </p>
